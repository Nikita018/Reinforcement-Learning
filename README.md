# Reinforcement-Learning
Experiments with different reinforcement learning techniques

Conclusions


Bandits and Exploration/Exploitation
Implemented an agent and learned about the effect of epsilon, an exploration parameter, on the performance of an agentand the effect of   size on the performance of the agent. Also learned about a good experiment practice of averaging across multiple runs
